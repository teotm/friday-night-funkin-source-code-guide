# About this Folder/Directory
1. Why there are batchfiles in mod?
- Cause if you are reading the [guide](https://github.com/teotm/some-trio-demo/blob/main/docs/helpWithMod/coding/README.md) you might not want to copy-paste this shit.
2. Why there are so many?
- I made for every command as separate batchfile and:
- - One batchfile containing all commands in one
- - Two batchfiles containing the two code blocks in the guide
3. Commands don't work.
- Install Haxe 4.1.5, Git and Visual Studio 2019.

If you have other questions about that directory create an issue.
